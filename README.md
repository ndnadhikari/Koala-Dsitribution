**Here are the folders and descriptions:**

1. coding_challenge.R => This is the R script to extract and prepare the data for static visualisation and the Shiny app.
2. papers => This folder contains some interesting papers.
3. shinyapp => It has R code to develop the Shiny app. Unfortunately, the shapefile could not be uploaded due to its large size.
4. Australia => It contains the shapefile to visualize the map, but unfortunately, the extracted file could not be uploaded, so a zip file has been provided.
5. plots => Static plots used to explore the data.


**Instructions to develop the Shiny App:**
The data is prepared using the R script (coding_challenge.R). It utilises data from three different sources:
1. Galah package from CRAN.
2. Shapefile (source: link).
3. WorldClim data (source: link) for temperature and precipitation.
