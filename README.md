1. coding_challenge.R => This is the R script to extract and prepare the data for static visualisation and the Shiny app.
2. papers => This folder contains some interesting papers.
3. shinyapp => It has R code to develop the Shiny app. Unfortunately, the shapefile could not be uploaded due to its large size.
